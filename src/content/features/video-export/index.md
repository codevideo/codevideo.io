Transform your coding tutorials into professional videos without screen recording or editing. CodeVideo's Video Export feature takes your JSON action sequence and generates high-quality tutorial videos that look like they took hours to create—all in just minutes.

## How It Works

Converting your JSON actions into a polished video tutorial is simple:

1. **Create your action sequence** - Define what happens in your tutorial using our intuitive studio interface or direct JSON editing
2. **Preview in real-time** - See exactly how your tutorial will look and make adjustments as needed
3. **Export to video** - Generate an MP4 file ready for sharing on YouTube, your course platform, or internal training systems

<!-- ![Video Export Workflow](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/placeholder-export-workflow.gif) -->

The process is entirely deterministic—meaning you'll get the exact same high-quality result every time without the variability of manual recording.

## Key Benefits

### Save Hours of Production Time

Eliminate the cycle of recording, making mistakes, re-recording, and editing. Create professional tutorials in minutes instead of hours.

Traditional screen recording typically takes 3-5x the length of the final video to produce. With CodeVideo's Video Export, you can create a 10-minute tutorial in about 15 minutes total.

### Perfect Execution Every Time

No more typos, "umms," or background noise. Every tutorial is perfectly executed with clean code, clear narration, and professional presentation.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "author-speak-before",
    "value": "Welcome to this tutorial on creating Python functions. Let's get started by creating a new file."
  },
  {
    "name": "file-explorer-create-file",
    "value": "functions.py"
  },
  {
    "name": "author-speak-before",
    "value": "Now let's create a simple greeting function."
  },
  {
    "name": "editor-type",
    "value": "def greet(name):\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\nprint(greet(\"World\"))"
  },
  {
    "name": "author-speak-after",
    "value": "This function takes a name parameter and returns a greeting string. Let's see it in action."
  },
  {
    "name": "terminal-type",
    "value": "python functions.py"
  },
  {
    "name": "terminal-enter",
    "value": ""
  },
  {
    "name": "terminal-output",
    "value": "Hello, World!"
  },
  {
    "name": "author-speak-after",
    "value": "As you can see, when we run the code, it outputs 'Hello, World!'. You can customize this function for different use cases."
  }
]
```

The code above defines a sequence that will be rendered as a perfect tutorial segment every time, with natural-sounding narration and professional code typing.

### Easy Updates and Maintenance

Need to make a change? Simply update your JSON actions and re-export—no need to re-record entire sections of your tutorial.

When libraries or frameworks update, you can easily modify your tutorials to reflect the changes without starting from scratch.

### Consistent Branding and Style

Maintain consistent pacing, style, and quality across all your tutorial videos, regardless of when they were created or who created them.

Your entire team can create tutorials with the same professional quality, ensuring your brand's educational content maintains a cohesive look and feel.

### Optimized for All Platforms

Videos are generated with optimal settings for different platforms, ensuring your tutorials look great whether viewed on YouTube, course platforms, or social media.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Styling and Themes

Customize the look and feel of your videos with:
- Custom color schemes
- Font selections
- IDE themes
- Logo placement
- Intro/outro sequences

### Voice Customization

Choose from multiple voice options or use your own recorded audio to narrate your tutorials. Mix and match to create the perfect presentation.

Create tutorials in multiple languages from the same action sequence—perfect for reaching global audiences without recreating content from scratch.

### Integration with Other Exports

The same JSON actions used for video can be exported to other formats, creating a complete educational package:
- Video tutorials

- Interactive web tutorials
- Slide presentations with our `slide-display` action
- PDF guides

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What video formats are supported?

CodeVideo currently exports to MP4 format with H.264 encoding, which is compatible with virtually all platforms and devices.

### Can I use my own voice for narration?

Yes! We recommend you clone your voice using ElevenLabs, as this is the most integrated text to speech options so far. You can record your own audio narration and integrate it with the video export, or use our text-to-speech options.

### How long does the export process take?

Typically a video export takes the same amount of time as the video length. For example, a 10-minute video will take about 10 minutes to export. Static exports such as slides, HTML, and PDFs are instantaneous.

### What resolution and quality settings are available?

We support both landscape and portrait exports at 720p, 1080p, and 4K resolutions, with adjustable quality settings to balance file size and clarity.

### Can I add custom branding to my videos?

Yes, you can add your logo, custom intro/outro sequences, and personalized color schemes to maintain your brand identity.

### Is there a limit to video length?

The free plan supports videos up to 10 minutes in length. Premium plans allow for unlimited video duration.
