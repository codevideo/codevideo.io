# CodeVideo

> A revolutionary platform for creating educational software content 1000x faster using declarative, action-based video generation. Transform JSON actions into professional tutorials, documentation, and multi-format exports without screen recording or video editing.

CodeVideo is a deterministic recording system that allows creators to build educational programming content by defining sequences of actions rather than manually recording them. The platform uses a virtual IDE environment to simulate coding activities, enabling the generation of videos, markdown documentation, PDFs, presentations, and web content from a single source of truth.

Key innovations include:
- **Declarative Video Creation**: Specify what should happen rather than manually recording
- **Action-Based System**: Control editors, terminals, file explorers, and more through JSON actions
- **Multi-Format Export**: Generate videos, blog posts, PDFs, presentations, and websites from one source
- **Deterministic Accuracy**: Every step is guaranteed correct with no need for retakes
- **Virtual IDE**: Simulate development environments without actual screen recording
